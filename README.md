# Store-Demand-Forecasting-Using-Time-Series-Analysis
This project focuses on building a machine learning and time series forecasting model to predict future product demand at a retail store level. By leveraging historical sales data, we aim to optimize inventory levels, minimize stockouts, reduce overstock, and support smarter supply chain decisions.
